Here, I decide to edit front-end books-ui for best practices.
So I putted attribute data-test for rows of books and be able
of search by that special attribute. Sacrificing best location
on element, such as differencing name from author; in this case
I assume allways will be 2 column name and 3 author.
Another assumption it's there will be no more than 50 books,
because there will be another page on pagination and may not
found some book in the DOM.
