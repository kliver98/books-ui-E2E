Here, I decide to edit front-end books-ui for best practices.
So I putted attribute data-test for rows of books and be able
of search by that special attribute. Sacrificing best location
on element, such as differencing name from author; in this case
I assume allways will be 2 column name and 3 author.
Another assumption it's there will be no more than 50 books,
because there will be another page on pagination and may not
found some book in the DOM.
There is an error that 'x' does not do anything, when add book.
