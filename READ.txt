Here, I decide to edit front-end books-ui for best practices.
So I putted attribute data-test for rows of books and elements
like input and buttons to be able of search by that special attribute.
Sacrificing best location on element, such as differencing name from author; 
in this case I assume allways the 2 td will be name and 3 td author.
Another assumption it's there will be no more than 50 books,
because there will be another page on pagination and may not
found some book in the DOM.
There is a bug that 'x' does not do anything, when add book.
But I don't fixed.
